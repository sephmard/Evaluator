# Evaluation Techniques

Follow step-by-step guides for different evaluation scenarios and methodologies in NeMo Evaluator.

## Before You Start

Ensure you have:

1. Completed the initial getting started guides for {ref}`gs-install` and {ref}`gs-quickstart`.
2. Have your endpoint and API key ready or prepared for the checkpoint you wish to deploy.
3. Prepared your [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) for accessing gated datasets.


## Evaluations

Select an evaluation type tailored to your model capabilities.
