# Contributing to NeMo Evaluator & NeMo Evaluator Launcher

We welcome contributions to the NeMo Evaluator projects! This document provides guidelines for contributing to both the `nemo-evaluator` core framework and `nemo-evaluator-launcher` orchestration tool.

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher (up to 3.13)
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python package management
- Git for version control

### Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing two packages:

- **`packages/nemo-evaluator`** - Core evaluation library (required for building docs)
- **`packages/nemo-evaluator-launcher`** - CLI and orchestration layer

Each package has its own virtual environment managed by UV. Choose your setup based on what you're contributing to.

### Setup

1. **Install UV**

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Evaluator
   ```

3. **Set up development environment**

   Choose the setup that matches your contribution:

   **For Launcher Development:**

   ```bash
   cd packages/nemo-evaluator-launcher
   uv sync --all-extras
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

   **For Core Library Development:**

   ```bash
   cd packages/nemo-evaluator
   uv sync --all-extras
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

   **For Documentation:**

   ```bash
   # 1. First, sync the documentation dependencies
   make docs-env

   # 2. Build the HTML documentation
   make docs-html

   # 3. View the built documentation
   python3 -m http.server --directory docs/_build/html 8000
   ```

   Then open your browser to: http://localhost:8000

   If you want to see changes in real-time as you edit run the command below:

   ```bash
   # This starts a live-reload server that automatically rebuilds on changes
   make docs-live
   ```
   This will start a server at http://localhost:8000 that automatically rebuilds when you save changes to any documentation files.

### Development Tools

The project uses the following tools for development:

- **UV**: Fast Python package installer and resolver
- **Ruff**: Code formatting and linting
- **MyPy**: Static type checking
- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks for code quality

## Code Style and Quality

### Formatting

We use Ruff for consistent code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code manually
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Or run pre-commit to format and check everything
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Type Checking

We enforce strict type checking with MyPy. All public functions and methods must have type annotations.

### Code Quality Guidelines

1. **Follow Python conventions**: Use PEP 8 style guidelines (enforced by the linting tool above)
2. **Type annotations**: All public APIs must have complete type annotations
3. **Documentation**: Add docstrings for all public classes and methods
4. **Error handling**: Use explicit error handling with appropriate exception types
5. **Testing**: Write tests for new functionality and bug fixes
6. **Logging**: Use structured logging via `structlog` instead of print statements

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_specific_module.py

# Run tests without network access (default)
uv run pytest --disable-network
```

### Test Structure

- Unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory
- Test files should follow the naming pattern `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Group related tests in classes when appropriate
- Mock external dependencies and network calls

### Writing Tests

1. **Test coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for core functionality
2. **Test isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on others
3. **Clear assertions**: Use descriptive assertion messages
4. **Mock external dependencies**: Use `pytest` fixtures and mocking for external services

## Validating Documentation Snippets (Optional)

Documentation builds without executing code snippets, but you may want to validate that snippets are syntactically correct and have valid imports.

To validate snippets that import from both packages:

```bash
# Set up launcher environment with core library
cd packages/nemo-evaluator-launcher
uv sync --all-extras
uv pip install -e ../nemo-evaluator/

# Activate environment and validate a snippet
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m py_compile docs/evaluation/_snippets/api-examples/basic_evaluate.py
```

**Note**: Most snippets require actual model endpoints to run, so validation only checks syntax and imports, not execution.

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. **Create an issue**: For significant changes, create an issue first to discuss the approach
2. **Branch naming**: Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-new-exporter`, `fix/memory-leak`)
3. **Code quality**: Ensure all checks pass:

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   uv run pytest
   ```

### PR Requirements

1. **Clear description**: Explain what the PR does and why
2. **Tests**: Include tests for new functionality or bug fixes
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation if needed
4. **Type safety**: Ensure MyPy passes without errors
5. **Backwards compatibility**: Avoid breaking changes unless necessary

### PR Process

1. **Fork the repository**: External contributors should fork the repository to their GitHub account
2. **Clone and branch**: Clone your fork and create a feature branch from `main`
3. **Make changes**: Implement your changes with tests
4. **Test thoroughly**: Run the full test suite
5. **Push to fork**: Push your branch to your forked repository
6. **Submit PR**: Create a pull request from your fork's branch to the main repository
7. **Address feedback**: Respond to review comments
8. **Squash commits**: Clean up commit history before merging

## Adding New Features

4. Add configuration schema
5. Write comprehensive tests
6. Update documentation

### Exporters (NeMo Evaluator Launcher)

## Signing Your Work

- We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  - Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

- To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```

## 🚀 Running GitHub CI

There are two ways to trigger CI tests on your pull request:

### Automatic CI Triggering

If your GitHub user is configured to use [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification), CI tests will run automatically when you push commits to your pull request.

> **Note**: Signed commits are different from signing-off on commits (which uses the `-s` flag mentioned in the [Signing Your Work](#signing-your-work) section).

### Manual CI Triggering

If you don't have signed commits set up, you can still trigger CI tests manually by commenting on your pull request:

```
/ok to test <commit-SHA>
```

For example:

```
/ok to test a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

**Important**: You'll need to add this comment for each new commit you push to ensure CI tests run on the latest changes.

#### Finding Your Commit SHA

You can find the commit SHA in several ways:

- View your pull request's commit history on GitHub
- Run `git log --oneline -1` in your local repository
- Check the commit details in your Git client
